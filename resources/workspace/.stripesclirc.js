/*
  Intentionally empty!
  This prevents any Stripes CLI configs defined above from interfering with a newly created workspace.
  If you want to share Stripes CLI configs across multiple workspaces, delete this file.

  Expecting to see aliases?
  Aliases are defined in each platform directory's .stripesclirc config file. This allows for serving of apps in isolation without altering aliases.
  If you want to share aliases across multiple platforms in the same workspace, then modify this file and remove your platform's .stripesclirc.
  Note: doing so will prevent independent serving apps, unless the aliases are manually commented out (or an empty .stripesclirc exists within the app directory).
